The "Autoviolators" project features two user roles: regular users and auto inspectors. 
Regular users can report traffic violations by providing the location, license plate number, 
a description of the violation, and a photo. Each report is assigned a status of "Accepted", 
"Rejected", or "Completed". The system's main interface is a search page with a table that displays the reported violations.
